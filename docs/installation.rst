Installation
============

You can install **ManimPango** using **pip**:

There are prebuild wheels for both Windows and macOS.

For **Linux Users**, there are no Wheels. You must have a C compiler as well
as **Pango** and its dependencies along with the **Pango** development headers.
See :ref:`building` for more information.
